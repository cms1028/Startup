From this assignment I learned that web programming is going to be really hard and confusing and I don't know if I want to do it anymore.

After working on the EC2 and getting my website set up I've got a slightly better handle on what is going on. I hope I can continue to stay on top of it.

I got simon working on my domain, now I need to figure out how to edit and change the data to display what I want on my own domain.

CSS is finally done. Took a while to figure out and it's a lot to remember, but I'm getting there. Definitely needed a lot of help.
