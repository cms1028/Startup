# Chess RPG: The Story of a Pawn
Imagine the game of chess was made into a role playing game, where you the player start as a humble pawn, but through your ever forward efforts and battles, you can become a knight, rook, bishop, or queen. The story starts in the small town of Pawn Yard, where aspiring many pawns set off on their adventure to greatness. You start as a humble pawn and prepare for your journey onto the great Board. Complete quests and games for cash to gear up and fight rival pieces to level up your pawn. The adventure of who you will become is all up to you.
